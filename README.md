Welcome visitors from the [17th International Radiance Workshop]( http://climate-based-daylighting.com/doku.php?id=radiance2018:programme#workshop_programme )

### Full Screen: [Spider RAD Viewer]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-rad-viewer/rad-viewer/ )

* A basic Radiance RAD file viewer
* Open, display and manipulate RAD files in real-time 3D in your browser
* Built with plain-vanilla JavaScript using the Three.js library
* All free and open source on GitHub with an MIT license

### Read Me: [Spider RAD Viewer Cookbook]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-rad-viewer/cookbook/ )

* A collection of scripts that enhance the basic file viewer to carry out specific tasks
	* Point cursor at a surface and view its geometry and materials in a pop-up:[Spider Rad Viewer with Pop-Up Info]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-rad-viewer/cookbook/rad-viewer-pop-up-info )
	* Display a slide-show carousel of RAD files: [/RAD Viewer Iframe Carousel]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-rad-viewer/cookbook/rad-viewer-iframe-carousel/ )
	* View all the RAD files in a GitHub repository: [RAD Sample File Gallery]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-rad-viewer/cookbook/rad-sample-file-gallery/ )
	* More scripts are available in the Cookbook

## Concept / Issues to be addressed

View RAD files produced by Radiance scripts in interactive 3D in your browser

And provide new-user support for [Radiance Online]( https://www.radiance-online.org/ )

Radiance Software may be used to produce stunning images with engaging effects. Interestingly the [The RADIANCE 5.1 Synthetic Imaging System.pdf]( http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/refman.pdf ) contains a single diagram and no images in its twenty pages. The [Radiance ManPages.pdf]( https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/manpages.pdf ) contains zero images within its **227** pages.

Let's see if we can help do something about helping illustrate the beauties of Radiance software

### Mission

Translate Radiance RAD file types into Three.js views - all building on [Mostapha's efforts]( https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari/radJSON)

* Select and display files very quickly
* Reduce labor needs and increase engineering insights
* Easy code you learn from and easily adapt to your specific needs

### Vision

* Help make it faster, easier, simpler to do cataloguing and file management on large numbers of Radiance RAD files


## Features

* Select, open, view and manipulate Radiance RAD Files
* Open file or files via
	* Operating system dialog box - single or multiple files
	* URL - remote or local - supplied by a [location.hash]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location ) update - single files only for now
* Select files from lists of links to available online [sample RAD files]( file:///D:/Dropbox/Public/git-repos/spider/index.html#radiance-sample-files/README.md )
* Display RAD files in interactive 3D with rotate, zoom and pan
* View RAD file data
	* Native text format
	* Translated to JSON
* Basic look-up table supplies a basic polygon color palette if no material specified
* Handles openings in surfaces moderately well
* Update scene settings: rotation, wireframe mode, edges visibility, surfaces opacity
* Written in plan-vanilla JavaScript
	* Single dependency: Three.js
	* No need for a server: run locally or offline


## To do / wish list

See this GitHub Project: [Spider RAD Viewer Dev]( https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-rad-viewer/projects/1 )


## Issues

See GitHub issues: [Spider RAD Viewer Issues]( https://github.com/ladybug-tools/spider-rad-viewer/issues )


## Links of Interest

Spider

* [Radiance Sample Data Files]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#radiance-sample-files/README.md )
	* As and when we start receiving more sample files these folders wil be forked into theor own repository


Radiance

* [17th International Radiance Workshop]( http://climate-based-daylighting.com/doku.php?id=radiance2018:programme#workshop_programme )
* [The RADIANCE 5.1 Synthetic Imaging System.pdf]( http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/refman.pdf )
* [Radiance ManPages.pdf]( https://www.radiance-online.org/learning/documentation/manual-pages/pdfs/manpages.pdf )


## Notes

This repo replaces and deprecates the following scripts
* [RAD to JSON]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#cookbook/rad-to-json/README.md )
* [Radiance RAD to Three.js]( https://rawgit.com/ladybug-tools/spider/master/#cookbook/rad-to-threejs/README.md )
* [radJSON Fork]( https://rawgit.com/ladybug-tools/spider/master/#cookbook/rad-json-fork/README.md )
* [Rad Viewer]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#rad-viewer/README.md )


Try to follow Mostapha's suggestions

1. Keep the code clean.
2. Test the code.
3. Learn from the code and hack it for other uses.
4. And finally use the repository as a dependency. Especially when it comes to JavaScript we can use GitHub submodules functionality between the repositories.
