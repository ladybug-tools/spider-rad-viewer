# [Archives Read Me]( #archives/README.md )


## Concept


This folder contains various files once used elsewhere in this repo.

Yes, git, does provide an incredible ability to view any file from any time,

It's also nice to be able to just click on a file and see it run.

Putting it another way: the stuff you see here did not just appear by magic. It's the result of many humans efforts. Seeing a visible record of its history is proof of those efforts.
